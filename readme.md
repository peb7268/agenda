#Backbone Basics

A typical Backbone workflow, at least from what ive seen, consists of a series of steps: 
1. You start with the model. Your data. A contact, todo, person, chart, or some other data object. 
2. Then make a collection to handle multiples of that model. 
3. Next we make a view that represents one of those models. 
4. Lastly we make an aggregate view that represents your app as a whole in whome the smaller views will be nested.
